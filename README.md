## Syscall-IDS

Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) that identifies anomalies in system call traces by leveraging a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to distinguish between normal (clean) and potentially malicious (infected) behaviors.

| Technique/Feature                   | Description                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Engineering                 | Conversion of syscall info into high-dimensional feature vectors.                    |
| Probabilistic Syscall Subclustering | Gaussian mixture models for granular syscall behavior understanding.                 |
| Temporal Dependency Modeling        | Markov chains capture transitions between syscall states as a function of time.      |
| Buffer Overflow Detection           | Gaussian interval of string argument lengths to catch overflow attempts.             |
| Pathname Similarity Analysis        | Self-organizing maps to visualize and detect anomalies in syscall pathnames.                         |
| DoS Attack Detection                | Markov chain edge frequency analysis per-trace for DoS detection.                    |
| Segmentation                        | Autocorrelation + suffix trees to segment traces and proces each segment seperately. |
